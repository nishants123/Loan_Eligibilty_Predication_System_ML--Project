# Loan_Eligibilty_Predication_System_ML--Project


üîç Project Overview:

This project involves building a machine learning model to predict loan eligibility based on applicant data such as income, loan amount, credit history, and other demographic factors. The process included thorough data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and training multiple classification algorithms to determine the most accurate model. The final model achieved a training accuracy of 85% and a testing accuracy of 81%, indicating robust performance with minimal overfitting. The results were also visualized and summarized effectively using charts and presentations to aid interpretation and decision-making.


üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used:

Excel: Used for initial data inspection, manual data exploration, and organizing raw data before preprocessing.

Python: The primary programming language used for scripting, modeling, and analysis.

Pandas: Used for data preprocessing, handling missing values, feature selection, and data manipulation.

NumPy: Utilized for numerical computations and efficient array operations.

Matplotlib: Used to create static visualizations for understanding data distributions and model outcomes.

Seaborn: Employed for statistical visualizations such as correlation heatmaps, box plots, and pair plots.

Scikit-learn: Used for model building, including data splitting, training classification algorithms, and performance evaluation.

MLxtend: Applied for visualizing decision boundaries and plotting confusion matrices and learning curves.

PowerPoint: Used for summarizing the project insights, visualizations, and presenting model findings to stakeholders.

Jupyter Notebook: Provided an interactive coding environment for combining code, visuals, and analysis in one place for easier documentation and presentation.
